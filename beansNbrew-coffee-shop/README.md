# Bean & Brew Equipment Inventory Management System

The **Bean & Brew Equipment Inventory Management System** is a web-based application developed using the Spring Framework with a Java back end and an Angular front end. It manages product and part inventories for a coffee equipment store. The system allows users to:

- View, add, and update products and associated parts
- Track inventory levels with minimum and maximum thresholds
- Handle purchases and decrement product inventories
- Display success or failure messages for purchase actions
- Customize the front end with responsive design and consistent styling using Bootstrap and custom CSS

Additional features include validation logic to ensure inventory levels are maintained, an "About" page to provide company information, and sample inventory seeding based on business rules. The system also includes unit tests for key functionality such as inventory limits.
